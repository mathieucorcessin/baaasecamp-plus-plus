# Baaasecamp++

At Yes We Dev, we use Basecamp with our clients. I developed this extension to add more functionality to Basecamp and save time.

âš  I'm Product Manager, not developer, code could propably be improved.

## Help

- If the Bulk Archive button isn't displayed, refresh the page.
- If the Bulk Archive button doesn't create a checkbox before each message, refresh the page, scroll down to load all the messages and try again.
- If nothing happened after submitting the bulk actions, open the developer console (F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I), and if there is an error, go back to "How to install" and check that you did everything correctly.
